Hello,

I'm working with the Instagram API, and when I redirect the user to IG to authenticate him with my application, it is ok. But to add a context attached at this request, I want to add a query param to the "redirect_uri" like this "workflow=auth".

<b>https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?</b>

with these parameters

<ul>
    <li>client_id=CLIENT_ID</li>
    <li>response_type=code</li>
    <li>redirect_uri=http://localhost:5000/auth/instagram/callback/?workflow=auth</li>
</ul>

On Instagram API, the "redirect_uri" specify is: http://localhost:5000/auth/instagram/callback/

But, the documentation said it is possible to add some query params
